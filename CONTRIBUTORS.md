# Gender / Novels Contributors

The Gender / Novels project began in Fall 2018 with an undergraduate cohort of students working with a faculty director and two postdocs as part of the [MIT/SHASS Programs in Digital Humanities](https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu/). This program is funded by the [Mellon Foundation](https://www.mellon.org/).

Everyone involved listed below have contributed to the projectâ€™s design, development, implementation, contextualization, and maintenance. Read more about their contributions on the [team roles page](http://gendernovels.digitalhumanitiesmit.org/info/team_roles).

Students participated as part of one of three groups: Data, Analysis, and Deployment. Each contributor had an individual role as part of this work, and they collaborated across teams to develop this project.
